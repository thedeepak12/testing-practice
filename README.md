# Testing Practice

This project is focused on practicing testing principles and techniques using JavaScript. This project includes exercises to get hands-on experience with writing unit tests, testing functions, and learning about various testing methods in the context of web development.

## Exercises

- Capitalize Function: Created a function to capitalize the first letter of a string.
- Reverse String Function: Built a function to reverse a given string.
- Calculator Object: Implemented a calculator with basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- Caesar Cipher Function: Developed a function to encrypt strings using a Caesar cipher with a specified shift.
- Array Analysis Function: Created a function to analyze an array and return its average, minimum, maximum, and length.

## Tech Stack

* **JavaScript**
* **Jest** (Testing framework)
* **Node.js** (Environment for running JavaScript outside the browser)

## What I Learned

* **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Gained hands-on experience in writing tests before the code, which helped in better designing functions and thinking about edge cases early on.
* **Unit Testing with Jest**: Learned to write unit tests using Jest, enabling me to check that functions work as expected by comparing actual outputs to expected results.
* **Modular Code Design**: Developed modular, reusable functions while maintaining testability and adhering to clean code principles.
